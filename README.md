# lebanon-nonprofits

A list of Lebanese non-profits that can help get aid to affected families from the recent disaster.

Please note that in this time of economic turmoil in Lebanon, direct money transfer is not as you might have it in your country of residence. 

Therefore, I encourage you to get in direct contact with the non-profit you feel most comfortable with and see how you can help whether it's by sending money, care packages, or any way they might suggest and you feel okay doing. 

**DISCLAIMER**: I do not endorse nor can I guarantee the legitimacy of these organizations.

Therefore, given the uncertainty and the distance, you may not know if a non profit is truly verified.

To that, I have put in with every item in the list a "trust level". A trust level is based on how I got to hear about these organizations and is divided into 3 categories so far: 


1. `Direct`: it means either I or a direct family member has a direct knowledge of this organization and the trust level is high.  

2. `Direct word of mouth`: it means either I or a direct family member has heard about this but we do not have direct knowledge or contact with them. 

3. `Word of mouth`: Simply an organization that have made its way to my social feed and the only verification I have is word of mouth. 

If you know of non profits that can help at this time, please feel free to contribute to this repository.

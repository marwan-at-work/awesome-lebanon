# Awesome Lebanon

A list of Lebanese non-profits that can help get aid to affected families from the recent disaster.

#### Please note that in this time of economic turmoil in Lebanon, direct money transfer/donations may not be as easy as they are in the US or other countries. Also some Lebanese non-profits may not have the capability to launch and maintain websites with donation capabilities.

**Therefore**, I encourage you to get in direct contact with the non-profit you feel most comfortable with and see how you can help whether it's by sending money, care packages, or any way they might suggest and you feel okay doing. 

**DISCLAIMER**: I do not endorse nor can I guarantee the legitimacy of these organizations.

Therefore, given the uncertainty and the distance, you may not know if a non profit is truly verified.

To that, I have put in with every item in the list a "trust level". A trust level is based on how I got to hear about these organizations and is divided into 3 categories so far: 


1. `Direct`: it means either I or a direct family member has a direct knowledge of this organization and the trust level is high.  

2. `Direct word of mouth`: it means either I or a direct family member has heard about this non-profit directly from a person we know. However, we do not have direct contact with the organization. 

3. `Word of mouth`: Simply an organization that have made its way to my social feed and the only verification I have is word of mouth. 

If you know of non profits that can help at this time, please feel free to contribute to this repository.
